FocusLog: The Conscious Productivity Tracker

FocusLog is a minimal, cross-platform, "always-on-top" desktop application for obsessive productivity users who want to track their real effort, not just elapsed time.

The Problem

We often set aside a 2-hour block for "deep work" to get into "The Zone." But during that time, we get distracted. We check our phone, browse a non-work tab, get up for a snack, or get pulled into a conversation.

When we look back, our 2-hour "work" session only resulted in 25 minutes of actual, focused progress. Most productivity trackers either log total time or try (and fail) to automatically guess if you're "working," but they don't track your intent.

The Solution: Conscious Accountability

FocusLog helps you measure your Real Productivity by forcing you to be accountable.

Instead of automatic tracking, FocusLog requires you to consciously press an "Interrupt Work" button when you get distracted. This activates a separate "Distracted" timer (while the "Total" timer keeps running). When you're ready to focus again, you press "Back to Work."

This simple, manual action provides a powerful psychological separation and gives you an honest, undeniable metric at the end of the day:

Real Productivity Time = Total Session Time - Total Distracted Time

Core Features

Project-Based Tracking: Organize your work into different projects.

Total vs. Real Time: Every project tracks three key lifetime metrics: Total Time (clock running), Total Distraction (time spent interrupted), and REAL Time (Total - Distraction).

Conscious Distraction Logging: Manually log interruptions and categorize them (e.g., "Check Phone," "Other Distractions") to see what's really breaking your focus.

Detailed Session Logs: Review every individual work session for a project, including its date, total time, distracted time, and real productivity time.

Always-on-Top (Sticky) Mode: A small, 500x500 (approx) window that stays visible on top of all other windows, so your timer is always a glance away.

Multi-User Support: Simple, password-less user profiles to separate data if a computer is shared.

"Don't Forget" Nudges: A toggle-able list of reminders (e.g., "Drink water," "Put phone away") visible right in the timer interface.

i18n Support: Full interface translation between English and Spanish, selectable in Settings.

Import/Export: Easily back up all your user data (projects, logs, settings) to a JSON file and import it on a new machine.

Tech Stack

Language: Python 3

GUI Framework: PyQt6

Database: SQLite 3 (for local, server-less data storage)

Roadmap

[ ] Pixel Art UI: Implement a full pixel-art theme for all interface elements.

[ ] Advanced Analytics: Add charts to the "Project Log" to visualize distraction patterns.

This is a personal project. Feel free to fork it, but the primary goal is to build a tool for a specific, conscious workflow
